# Push_button

In this task, we controlled the LED using a push button, when the button pressed the LED will light up.

Connect the Arduino circuit :

Push button

1- The left leg of the push button to the 5V in the Arduino board.

2- The right leg of the push button to the digital pin 6 in the Arduino board and add a resistor to connect it with the GND.

LED:

1- The shorter leg of the LED with the resistor.

2- The resistor is connected with the GND in the Arduino board.

3- The longer leg of the LED with digital pin 7 in the Arduino board.

Connect the Arduino board to the computer with the USB and upload the code.

Output:
